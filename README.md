# cheap_flights_bot
✈️ This is a telegram bot that will search for you the CHEAPEST airplane tickets! 💸

As for now, the functionality of the code is following:

📊 There is a Google Spreadsheet, having information on the city/IATA code/Maximum price you're ready to spend.

🔍 Kiwi API searches for information from the spreadsheet, sorting the maximum price from the table.

📅 If there are any flights starting today and 30 days in the future for up to 10 days, there will be a notification on the telegram bot. Each time a person presses the "Next!" button triggers a new flight search.

💬 Telegram bot message.

As for now, whenever there are no more flight deals that will align with the requirements of the spreadsheets, the button "Finish!" will terminate the code. 🚫 Finish Button picture.

🔨 The project is not done yet. I am aiming at doing more functionality so that the user could enter:

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Passenger number and their type.
🚏 Maximum stopover number.
🛫 Flight class.
🌇 Starting city they are flying from.
💻 Data from the Spreadsheets that they could post from the chat.

Feel free to contribute to make this bot even better! 🤝 Happy flying! 🌍✈️
